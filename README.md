hich aims to be the most general-purpose Hi-C processing pipeline.
  - Population (bulk) and single cell
  - Targeted and non-targeted
  - Unmodified and bisulfite-converted DNA
  - Compatible with major formats: open2c (.cool, .mcool, .scool), Juicer (.hic), and HiCPro(.validPairs, .allValidPairs)
  - Advanced QC tools come built in
  - Powerful new features for homogenizing coverage when merging replicates or pseudobulking
  - Containerized for automated and reproducible installation of dependencies
  - Built on Nextflow, permitting use locally or on HPC environments
  - Simple to use. Some experiments can be processed with the simple command "nextflow run hich.nf"!

The hich logo is a DNA knot made with optical tweezers. Hi-C and other assays detect loops, compartments, and other 3D features of chromatin conformation.
